# First-bootcamp-challenge-accessibility
This is the first bootcamp challenge/assignment. This assignment is focused on creating an accessible website.

## Description

This was the first bootcamp challenge. It's purpose was to work learning to create an accessible website for all users to explore. The acceptance criteria was as follows: 

-Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
-HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
-Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
-Heading attributes fall in sequential order
-Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

Accessibility is an extremely important part of a well functioning website. People with special needs already have day to day struggles, due to which they are actively excluded from day to day activities. This assignment helps this issue, since it allows for everyone to access the website, regardless of their special needs. 

Through the course of this assignment, I learned the importance of writing code that is readable by more than just me. Using <div>  is not only unaccessible, but simply a disservice to myself when attempting to discifer my code later! Further, I learned the importance of semantic tags in CSS! Finding the section I needed to edit became much fasster this way!

This was an excellent task which developed my skills greatly! 


## Installation

N/A


## Usage

This website was intended to be tested for accessibility. All of the images have accessible alt tags and all of the tags are semantic. Most elements have a class - explaining the more specific use of the element in each case. 

## Credits

Although the script for this project was edited by myself, I would like to give credit to Calum Medlock and Henry Green for their helpful discussions, which inspired me to dig deeper and discover more edits to be made!
I would further like to give credit to my bootcamp class, all of whom contributed with helpful suggestions and explanations of concepts. 
The starter-code was provided by Trillogy Skills Bootcamp.
